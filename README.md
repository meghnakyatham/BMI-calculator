# BMI-calculator
Overview
This is a simple C program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height. BMI is a numerical value that provides an indication of whether a person's weight is appropriate for their height. It is commonly used as a screening tool to assess whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Prerequisites
To compile and run this BMI calculator, you need a C compiler installed on your system. A popular choice is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is available on most platforms.

How to Use
Open a text editor and copy the source code provided in the main.c file into a new file.

Save the file with a .c extension, e.g., bmi_calculator.c.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Compile the C program using the C compiler. For example, with GCC, use the following command:

gcc -o bmi_calculator bmi_calculator.c
This will generate an executable file named bmi_calculator in the same directory.

Run the program by entering the following command:
./bmi_calculator
The program will prompt you to enter your weight in kilograms and height in meters. Provide the required information as requested.

The program will then calculate your BMI and display the result along with a message indicating whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Note
Make sure to enter valid positive values for weight and height. The program will handle invalid inputs and display an error message if non-positive values are provided.
